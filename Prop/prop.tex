\noindent\makebox[\textwidth][c]{\Large\bfseries Plasma Wake-field Electron Accelerators}
Conventional electron accelerators both linear, such as the SLAC, and sycrotrons are several miles long. This is due to the main limiting factor of electronic breakdown that occurs on the sides of the accelerating tube. This limits the accelerating gradient to around 1000 MeV/m; so to get the energies required, more distance is needed.
