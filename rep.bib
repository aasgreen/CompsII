A comprehensive set of numerical simulations showed that a 150 fs, 1.33 PW pulse is self-guided over 10 cm of a static filling gaseous plasma of density 1–3×10 17  cm −3 and is stable against relativistic filamentation. A fully broken electromagnetic wake
                          (electron density 'bubble') is excited over the entire interaction length. Variations of bubble size and shape associated with nonlinear evolution of the driving pulse result in self-injection of background plasma electrons. Self-injection begins immediately after the first nonlinear laser focus, where pulse de-focusing forces the bubble to grow. Injection continues without interruption while the bubble expands, and ceases when the laser becomes self-guided and
                              bubble evolution stabilizes. Self-injected electrons are accelerated to ~7 GeV with less than 10% energy spread and ~1.3 nC charge. Numerical modelling of the laser pulse dynamics over the entire plasma length is carried out using a time-averaged, fully relativistic, quasi-static three-dimensional (3D) axi-symmetric particle-in-cell (PIC) code, WAKE. The process of electron self-injection is explored by means of both test-particle modelling (WAKE) and 3D PIC
                              simulations using the recently developed CALDER-Circ code in quasi-cylindrical geometry.}

                      abstract={Betatron x-ray radiation in laser–plasma accelerators is produced when electrons are accelerated and wiggled in the laser-wakefield cavity. This femtosecond source, producing intense x-ray beams in the multi-kiloelectronvolt (keV) range, has been observed at different interaction regimes using a high-power laser from 10 to 100 TW. However, none of the spectral measurements carried out were at sufficient resolution, bandwidth and
                          signal-to-noise ratio to precisely determine the shape of spectra with a single laser shot in order to avoid shot-to-shot fluctuations. In this paper, the Betatron radiation produced using a 80 TW laser is characterized by using a single photon counting method. We measure in a single shot spectra from 8 to 21 keV with a resolution better than 350 eV. The results obtained are in excellent agreement with theoretical predictions and demonstrate the synchrotron-type
                              nature of this radiation mechanism. The critical energy is found to be E c =5.6±1 keV for our experimental conditions. In addition, the features of the source at this energy range open up novel opportunities for applications in time-resolved x-ray science.}

                      abstract={We report 'snapshots' of laser-generated plasma accelerator structures acquired by frequency domain holography (FDH) and frequency domain shadowgraphy (FDS), techniques for visualizing quasi-static objects propagating near the speed of light. FDH captures images of sinusoidal wakes in mm-length plasmas of density 1< n e <5×10 18  cm −3 from phase modulations they imprint on co-propagating probe pulses. Changes in the wake structure (such as the
                              curvature of the wavefront), caused by the laser and plasma parameter variations from shot to shot, were observed. FDS visualizes laser-generated electron density bubbles in mm-length plasmas of density n e ≥10 19  cm −3 using amplitude modulations they imprint on co-propagating probe pulses. Variations in the spatio-temporal structure of bubbles are inferred from corresponding variations in the shape of 'bullets' of probe light trapped inside them
                          and correlated with mono-energetic electron generation. Both FDH and FDS average over structural variations that occur during propagation through the plasma medium. We explore via simulations a generalization of FDH/FDS (termed frequency domain tomography (FDT)) that can potentially record a time sequence of quasi-static snapshots, like the frames of a movie, of the wake structure as it propagates through the plasma. FDT utilizes several probe–reference
                          pulse pairs that propagate obliquely to the wake, along with tomographic reconstruction algorithms similar to those used in medical CAT scans.}

    abstract = {We demonstrate a single-shot method of visualizing the evolution of light-speed, laser-generated structures as they propagate over hundreds of Rayleigh lengths (typically \&\#x2265;10\&\#x2009;\&\#x2009;cm) through a tenuous medium. An ultrashort probe pulse crosses the object\&\#x2019;s path at a small angle (\&\#x3B8;\&lt;5\&\#xB0;) and a specific time delay. Copies of the phase-modulated probe are then relay-imaged to separate detectors from selected
        object planes along the propagation path. A phase-contrast technique based on Kerr effect and nonlinear absorption converts phase to intensity modulation, improving sensitivity in tenuous media. A continuous record of the probe phase modulation along the propagation path is reconstructed.},

It is thus expected that the development in the near-future of multi-PW-class laser and facilities will enable a vast range of scientific opportunities for laser plasma acceleration research. On one hand, high peak powers can be used to explore the extremely high intensity regime of laser wakefield acceleration, producing for example large amounts of
        electrons in the GeV range or generating high energy photons. On the other hand, the available laser energy can be used in the quasi-linear regime to create accelerating fields in large volumes of plasma and study controlled acceleration in a plasma stage of externally injected relativistic particles, either electrons or positrons. In the frame of the Centre Interdisciplinaire de la Lumière EXtrême (CILEX), the Apollon-10P laser will deliver two beams at the 1&#xa0;PW and
        10&#xa0;PW levels, in ultra-short ( &gt; 15 fs ) pulses, to a target area dedicated to electron acceleration studies, such as the exploration of the non-linear regimes predicted theoretically, or multi-stage laser plasma acceleration. "
